# Gradio DualVision

[![Hugging Face Space](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó%20Hugging%20Face%20-Space-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/toshas/gradio-dualvision)

DualVision is a Gradio template app for image processing. It was developed
to support the [Marigold](https://marigoldcomputervision.github.io) project. The app features:
- A web interface, powered by [Gradio](www.gradio.app) and [gradio-imageslider](https://github.com/pngwn/gradio-imageslider).
- Compatibility with desktop and mobile browsers.
- Native integration with Hugging Face Spaces.
- GPU support in the backend, including Hugging Face [ZeroGPU](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-zerogpu).
- Easily upload input images, including from the camera roll.
- Easily add configurable settings and see their effect instantly.
- Instant processing and side-by-side inspection.
- Multi-modal prediction: as it often happens, your algorithm can produce multiple images.
- Radio-buttons for easy switch between the inputs and produced outputs.
- A built-in examples gallery for a smoother user experience.

## Quick start

Check out the template image processing [app.py](app.py); copy it and start modifying! 

1. Install as a python package: `pip install git+https://github.com/toshas/gradio-dualvision.git`.
2. Create an `app.py` file.
3. Import and subclass from `DualVisionApp`.
4. Implement `build_user_components` and `process` methods, and optionally `make_header`.
5. Launch the app!

## DualVisionApp API

- `title`: Title of the application (str, required).
- `examples_path`: Base path where examples will be searched (Default: `"examples"`).
- `examples_per_page`: How many examples to show at the bottom of the app (Default: `12`).
- `examples_cache`: Examples caching policy, corresponding to `cache_examples` argument of gradio.Examples (Default: `"lazy"`).
- `squeeze_canvas`: When True, the image is fit to the browser viewport. When False, the image is fit to width (Default: `True`).
- `squeeze_viewport_height_pct`: Percentage of the browser viewport height (Default: `75`).
- `left_selector_visible`: Whether controls for changing modalities in the left part of the slider are visible (Default: `False`).
- `advanced_settings_can_be_half_width`: Whether allow placing advanced settings dropdown in half-column space whenever possible (Default: `True`).
- `key_original_image`: Name of the key under which the input image is shown in the modality selectors (Default: `"Original"`).
- `spaces_zero_gpu_enabled`: When True, the app wraps the processing function with the ZeroGPU decorator.
- `spaces_zero_gpu_duration`: Defines an integer duration in seconds passed into the ZeroGPU decorator.
- `slider_position`: Position of the slider between 0 and 1 (Default: `0.5`).
- `slider_line_color`: Color of the slider line (Default: `"#FFF"`).
- `slider_line_width`: Width of the slider line (Default: `"4px"`).
- `slider_arrows_color`: Color of the slider arrows (Default: `"#FFF"`).
- `slider_arrows_width`: Width of the slider arrows (Default: `2px`).
- `gallery_thumb_min_size`: Min size of the gallery thumbnail (Default: `96px`).
- `**kwargs`: Any other arguments that Gradio Blocks class can take.

**NB**: when setting `spaces_zero_gpu_enabled=True`, it may be required to add `import spaces` at the top of the app.py to
avoid the `RuntimeError` with "CUDA has been initialized before importing the `spaces` package".  

## Real talk

**Q: What is the idea behind this template?**<br>
A: Processing an image with various settings, inspecting multiple outputs side-by-side, and deploying such a demo with
readily-accessible examples is a common pattern in computer vision and image processing. This template extends upon
the [gradio-imageslider](https://github.com/pngwn/gradio-imageslider) custom component, adds modality selectors (radio
buttons), and connects it all nicely with the Gradio's built-in Examples functionality.  

**Q: Isn't it exactly what `gradio-imageslider` is doing?**<br>
A: Not quite. See the [gradio_dualvision/gradio_patches](gradio_dualvision/gradio_patches) directory for a complete set
of version-specific changes required to wire it all up _nicely_. Indeed, a custom component with all these functions 
would be more efficient.

**Q: What is the architecture of the template?**<br>
- Inputs: an input image (that is either uploaded or sent from Examples), and any settings you create in the 
`build_user_components` override.
- Outputs: a dictionary of `PIL.Image`s produced by your `process` function override, subsets of which you want to 
inspect side-by-side in the Slider.
- State: a hidden `gradio.Gallery` component that stores all the output modalities from your `process` override.
- Selectors: `gradio.Radio` buttons, which react to clicks and send requested images from the State to the Slider.
- Slider: `gradio-imageslider` custom component that allows using the slider to reveal parts of the images.
- Examples: `gradio.Examples` component that displays a gallery of example images, processes them upon the first click,
and caches the result for next users.

**Q: What are the conventions for `build_user_components` and `process` overrides?**<br>
- `build_user_components` defines `gradio` components and their layout, which will be visible in the "Advanced Settings" 
dropdown under the Slider component.
- Each such component will have a default value; it is possible to either hardcode it, or use a class variable, as it 
will be needed again in the `process` function (for example, define it as `self.DEFAULT_SETTING_VALUE`).
- Associate a string with each created setting (for example, `"setting_name"`) that you want to pass around and output 
a dictionary of them.
- `process` takes an image and `**kwargs`, which may or may not contain the settings of interest.
- To resolve a setting, use `kwargs.get("setting_name", self.DEFAULT_SETTING_VALUE)` in order to fall back to the 
initial value of this setting.
- This way, default settings will be applied only to Example images that did not have _custom example settings_.

**Q: How do I specify custom default arguments for an example image?**<br>
A: Just create a file called `<path_to_image>.settings.json` and populate it with the custom settings for this sample - 
they will take precedence over the global default settings.

**Q: How do I modify the app header?**<br>
A: Override the `make_header` method and use `gradio.HTML` or `gradio.Markdown` to customize the header.

**Q: What's up with the Example cats?**<br>
These are the cats of the Marigold authors!

## Limitations

- Does not work correctly inside the `TabbedInterface`.
- Double copying between the hidden gallery component and the slider introduces visible flickering.
- Fixed versions of `gradio==4.44.1` and `gradio_imageslider==0.0.20`; 
PRs are welcome but should start as a discussion in the [Issues](https://github.com/toshas/gradio-dualvision/issues) 
first.
